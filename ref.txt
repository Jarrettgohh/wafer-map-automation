NOTES:

--> Values listed below indicates the site number; and will be jumbled up when reading from HTML
-> Each wafer would always have 49 points
-> To find row to write in excel from the site number: (49 - site_number) + start_row

--> The wafer would be in order, as in each image for a particular batch of wafers would always be side by side

--> Fill up all data that the site number and defect fraction can be read, and leave cells that can't be read, as blank, with red highlight


--> To chain the image preprocessing
